# Python-for-Data-Analysis-Project
You work as a Data Analyst that sells a Point of Sales (POS) system to small to medium businesses in the US. Your company has hundreds of thousands of clients and continues to grow. (Maybe you work for Square, maybe Shopify, maybe Stripe, etc...) One of the sales teams got their hands on a dataset of business names and locations and they were trying to identify the companies that are not on the platform, in other words prospective sales targets. You have been tasked with determining the overlap between the list of prospective businesses and the internal client list.
